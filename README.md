# OWL 2 EL <-> Neo4J Mapping "Direct existentials"

This is a preliminary draft of our Neo4J to OWL 2 mapping. The goal is to be able to import a well defined subset of OWL 2 EL ontologies into and export them from Neo4J in such a way that entailments and annotations are preserved (not however the syntactic structure) in the ontology after the round-trip. The main differences of this mapping to other mappings (see References below) are
* its treatment of blank nodes in existential restrictions. Rather than creating blank nodes, we create direct edges between entities, labelled with the property of the existential restriction. This makes querying the graph more intuitive.
* its use of qualified safe labels for typing relations (which makes for easier querying)
* taking advantage of OWL implications (rather than relying on pure RDF syntax). Rather than merely mapping an asserted axiom into Neo4J, we are interested in the following **`implied`** relationships:
  * **Class-Class**. For two class names A and B, an annotation property P, and an object property name R, we consider three types of relationships
    * SubClassOf restrictions of the form A SubClassOf: B
    * Existential restrictions of the form A SubClassOf: R some B
    * Annotation assertions of the form A Annotations: P B
  * **Individual-Individual**. For two individuals i and j, an annotation property P and an object property R, we consider
    * Object property assertions of the form i Facts: R j
    * Annotation assertions of the form i Annotations: P j
  * **Class-Individual**. For a class A, an individual i, an annotation property P and an object property name R, we consider three types of relationships
    * Class assertions of the form i Types: A
    * Existential restrictions of the form i Types: R some B
    * Annotation assertions of the form C Annotations: P i
  * **Individual-Class**. For a class A, an individual i, an annotation property P and an object property name R, we consider
    * Existential restrictions of the form A SubClassOf: R value i
    * Annotation assertions of the form i Annotations: P A    

The most similar mapping to our is the one used by [Monarch Initiatives SciGraph](https://github.com/SciGraph/SciGraph/wiki/MappingToOWL). The main differences are:
* In SciGraph, IRIs are first class citizens everywhere, while we prioritise safe labels to make query construction easier. This is especially important for edge types: Instead of MATCH p=()-[r:`http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050`]->() RETURN p LIMIT 25, we prefer to say MATCH p=()-[r:part_of_obo]->() RETURN p LIMIT 25
* Anonymous class patterns are kept alongside so called "convenience" edges in SciGraph, the latter of which correspond to the way we treat edges in general.


Some **idiosyncracies** of our approach are:
* To be able to roundtrip, we create disconnected nodes in the Neo4J graph representing OWL properties so that we can represent metadata (such as labels or other annotations) pertaining to them.
* We introduce a number of properties based on the notion of label for easier yet unambiguous querying, which are materialised on all nodes. **qualified safe labels** in particular are used to type relationships. The use of these is predicated on the assumption that, for any given namespace, labels are unique. This should be tested prior to loading. Given an entity e (Example: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050),
  * **ns** corresponds to the namespace the relationship in question in question (Example: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_).
  * **short_form** corresponds to the remainder (or fragment) of the IRI of e. (Example: "BFO_0000050")
  * **label** corresponds to either
    * the first rdfs:label annotation encountered or, if there are no rdfs:label annotation,
    * the short_form, or, if there is no short_form,
    * the whole IRI (Example: "part of").
  * **safe label** (sl) is the **label**, with all non-alphanumeric characters being replaced by **_**. Trailing and heading underscores are removed, any sequence of underscores is replaced by a single underscore (Example: "part_of").
  * **curie** is the valid curie for an entity, i.e. the namespace and the short_form, separated by ":" (Example: "obo:BFO_0000050").
  * **qualified safe label** (qsl) is the safe label of an entity and its namespace, separated by **_** (Example: "part_of_bfo").
* An example use of an SL in Cypher is (:n)-[part_of_bfo]-(:x)
* Individuals are currently only typed with their most direct type
* We only support datatypes that are supported by both neo4j and OWL (other OWL2 datatypes will be cast to Neo4j:String, which means their typing information is lost in a round-trip):

 Neo4J | OWL 2 | Comment |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Integer | xsd:integer |  |
| String | xsd:string |  |
| Boolean | xsd:boolean | |
| Float | xsd:float |  |
| list | xsd:string | Follow JSON standard for representing list as string? |

* For properties and axioms, all annotations are treated as if they were to literals (i.e. they wont be connected to other entities)

For readibility, we omit the neo4j2owl namespaces in the OWL 2 EL Axiom Column;

PREFIX: n2o: <http://neo4j2owl.org/mapping#>
Prefix: : <http://neo4j2owl.org/mapping#>

## Entities

All entities in the ontology, i.e. classes, individuals, object properties, data properties, and annotation properties are represented as nodes in the graph. Relationship nodes are only added to hold metadata about relations, and are disconnected from the rest of the graph. The iri, sl and short_form attributes on Neo4J nodes are the only three attributes that are not mapped into corresponding rdf statements.

## Notes on mapping procedure
* If we use curies to indicated edge-type for OPs, we need labels as an attribute.

## Custom Neo4J properties
For edge types, node labels (in the Neo/Cypher sense of the term) and property keys, special characters and spaces can potentially be supported via the use of back-tick escaping, but avoiding them makes writing cypher much easier - especially if via script.

* iri, http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050
* short_form, BFO_0000050
* label, "part of"
* prefix, "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_"
* curie, BFO:0000050
* safe_label, part_of (replace non-alphanumeric by "_")
* qualified_safe_label (BFO:part_of) [[Maybe use alterntive to :, to avoid necessity of escape marke in Cypher]]

## Comparison to OWLStar

The OWLStar standard was recently proposed as a universal way of mapping OWL ontology property graphs (including, but not limited to: Neo4J and RDFStar)

Work is ongoing to align neo4j2owl and owlstar.

## Related user stories (internal use only)
* As a  developer writing OWL from the KB,  I want to be able to easily find the correct iri for all OWL entities from the database.
   => All nodes have an IRI.  All edges have an IRI or have a key  (e.g. short_form or Curie) that makes it easy to look up and IRI from the relevant node.  The key may be a edge type name or an edge attribute (neo4J property key).
* As a developer writing OWL from the KB, I want to be able to tell from all nodes and edges what type of OWL entity or axiom I should create.
  => There must be an unambiguous mapping from node:label (or some standard attribute) and edge types (or some standard attribute) to OWL entity and axiom types.
* As a developer writing to the database,  I need to know what identifiers it is safe to use to uniquely identify nodes for the purpose of merging in new content.
External content is loaded from ontologies that we don't have complete control over. Uniqueness of  rdfs:Label can not be relied upon (although it is typically a safe assumptions within the context of a single ontology).   short_form uniqueness is much safer, but Curies would be safer still.   
* As a developer writing to the database, I want to be able to easily and unambiguouysly refer  to existing entities.  =>
Using  full IRIs for this can be a big pain in the ass as, outside of OBO, these are hard to remember. Using curie's is somewhat easier, but can still be a pain.  Using short_forms is easiest, but to do this safely requires a commitment to short_form uniqueness.  While this cannot be absolutely guaranteed it is rare.
=> All nodes and edge-types have unique short_form or curie
* As a developer editing the DB I want to be able to easily write queries to check what information it contains.
I should be able to easily select major categories of content.  
I should be able to write queries using lexical identifiers (labels or something closely related to them), even if this is occasionally unreliable.
I should be able to use lexical identifiers (a readable neo4j:label or node attribute) to filter/select on major categories of entity (e.g. anatomical entity; expression pattern; genetic feature).  
* As a Geppetto developer, I should be able to find the display names to use for edges and property keys without having to mung text or run secondary lookups.
Edges should store rdfs:label; property keys should not be Qualified ?

# Implementation

* The neo4j2owl plugin for neo4j implements two procedures: `exportOWL()` and `owl2Import()`. The procedures are registered in [N2OProcedure](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/blob/master/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/N2OProcedure.java). The source code was losely based on [neosemantics](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neosemantics) once, but has evolved in a completely different direction. Also, `neosemantics` has matured a ton since `neo4j2owl` was first developed and serves a much larger number of use cases than `neo4j2owl` does. The main rationale for `neo4j2owl` is its handling of OWL existential restrictions (see above) as a primary source for relationships and its ability to roundtrip a subset of OWL2EL (import-export-import without loss of information). Furthermore, it was important for our use case to handle human readable labels (relation types) on edges in a standardised way, as well as using OWL2 EL reasoning to automatically infer node labels. It is implemented using the [OWLAPI](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi).
   * The functionality for `exportOWL()` is implemented in the [exporter](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/tree/master/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/exporter) java package.
   * The functionality for `owl2Import()` is implemented in the [importer](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/tree/master/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/importer) java package.
* Overview of the `exportOWL()` process ([src](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/blob/8052f9c4d210ff5797c4090c029d19e8a8bed3eb/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/exporter/N2OExportService.java#L37)): 
  1. Translate all nodes into OWL Entities. This requires OWL entity information (Class, AnnotationProperty, ObjectProperty etc) to be present on the nodes as neo4j labels.
  1. Translate all annotations on nodes into OWL2 AnnotationAssertion axioms. 
  1. Translate all SUBLCASSOF, INSTANCEOF relations into respective OWL Axioms.
  1. Translate all neo relations which correspond to AnnotationAssertion axioms between entities
  1. Translate all neo relations that correspond to Existential restrictions or ObjectPropertyAssertions
  1. Translate all neo relations that correspond to DataProperty assertions axioms between entities (e.g. C sub )
  1. Render the ontology as RDFXML and return to user.
* Overview of the `owl2Import()` process ([src](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/blob/8052f9c4d210ff5797c4090c029d19e8a8bed3eb/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/exporter/N2OExportService.java#L37)): 
  1. Load the ontology using the OWLAPI ([src](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/blob/master/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/importer/N2OImportService.java))
  1. Importing the ontology ([src](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/blob/master/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/importer/N2OOntologyImporter.java))
     1. Create a reasoner (ELK)  - the reasoner is used mainly to materialise the class hierarchy and individual types, as well as asserting dynamically configured labels (more about that later). Note that unsatisfiable classes are entirely _ignored_, due to the heavy reliance on reasoning during the process of importing!
     1. The ontology signature (OWLEntities like classes, individuals and object, data and annotation properties) is scanned and all entities imported into an internal structure (the actually import into neo4j is managed through CSV files).
     1. All all entities annotations are scanned and imported into an internal structure.
     1. All SubClassOf relations are imported into an internal structure with the help of a reasoner (this ensures that only the transitive reduct is imported).
     1. All ClassAssertion axioms are imported in the same way.
     1. All existential relations are imported into an external structure. Note that _currently no reasoning is performed to look to compute the transtive reduct of the existential graph_. This has to be done, if at all desired, directly on the ontology using a tool like [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/).
     1. Adding dynamic node labels. Based on an external configuration, labels can be defined as OWL class expression, which are now applied. For example, we can specify that all instances and subclasses of `'part of' some Body` are labelled as `Body part` in neo4j.
  1. Export all imported data from the internal structures to CSV and write into the neo4j `import` directory. ([src](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/blob/master/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/importer/N2ONeoCSVLoader.java))
  1. Load all CSVs previously exported to the neo4j `import` directory into neo4j using `LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM` ([src](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/neo4j2owl/blob/master/src/main/java/ebi/spot/neo4j2owl/importer/N2OOntologyImporter.java)).

Editors notes:
- Some notes on testing can be found [here](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/vfb-neo2owl-test)


Generation of safe labels:
- alphanumeric and underscore allowed
- other characters are encoded (for example, `has part':@"` results in `has_part3563`.

## Understanding the log file

- All cypher queries throughout the process will produce the same error messages when they fail: `"Cypher query did NOT complete successfully (ERROR): "`, followed by the cypher query that generated the error.
- Most non-trivial cypher queries (especially the CSV imports) will generate a success message when they executed correctly: `"Cypher finished successfully: "`, followed by the cypher query.
- Most errors thrown throughout the import process will result in the whole pipeline to fail, except:
  - If a dynamic label is not successfully added for whatever reason, the stack trace is printed along with a warning: `"FAILED adding label " + label + " to " + ces + ", see logs."`
